# Dance Pad for Arduino Leonardo

This code will enable an Arduino (tested with Leonardo) to convert a debounced completed circuit on digital pins to a key press.

I wrote this to replace a broken controller box for a metal pad I bought years ago. You should be able to adapt this code to work for switches that complete an electrical circuit.

My first Arduino project!
